# Reliable-HeartRate_SEN0213
This is an example Arduino code that takes the RAW heart rate input from the sensor, ignores the initial unstable readings and outputs a very stable rolling average reading, great for wearable and physical computing electronics projects. The code has easily changeable variables for fine turning.

# How to install
Before running the code you will need to install the required library to use the code.
1. Firstly go to https://github.com/lfwag/HeartSpeed to download the required library
2. 

Then download the code as a zip from this repository or click the following link (https://github.com/elliotth30/Reliable-HeartRate_SEN0213/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it into a folder, then open in Arduino IDE - before running like any other Arduino code (Detailed Instructions Below)




# How to Connect
Full instructions can be found at https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Heart_Rate_Monitor_Sensor_SKU__SEN0213, However this diagram on the site shows how to connect the board to an Arduino Uno through the following connection.
It is important to note that the electrodes are best places on bare skin so shave a small patch if you have lots of hair is adviced.
